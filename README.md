# Atavism Game Launcher for Windows
 A Game Launcher Originally designed with Patching Atavism games in mind, however, it should work for any other application that needs to be kept up to date as well.  The launcher provides validation of application files before launching.  A Unity scene is included which ensures the game was launched via the launcher, as well as doing it's own validation to make sure everything matches up before loading the next game scene (or erroring out).  This is the only game-side resource included, however, it could easily be used as a concept example to adapt versions for other game engines or applications as well.  This project is provided under a GPLv3 license.

The project language is PowerShell, you will need to use Sapien PowerShell Studio to build it (https://www.sapien.com/software/powershell_studio).
